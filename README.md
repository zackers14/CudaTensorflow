# TO DO


## Find inputs (images, as many as possible for processing/recognition training attempting to recognize a singular thing like cars, or traffic signs, etc)
## Understand and translate https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/estimators/cnn from python to C++
## Make the necessary changes for the NN to scan/read all alphanumeric characters

## Create a main class
## Come up with data structures that should be used for this project (if any)
## Create helper functions to load memory for kernel
## Create Kernel Function for Image Processing/Recognition training

### Refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_guides/cc/guide for API instructions for Tensorflow
### Refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_c for installation instructions

## Feel free to add more tasks or ask for clarification if/when needed
